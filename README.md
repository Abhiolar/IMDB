# Project---Module-3
ALL NOTEBOOKS ARE BEING USED NOW (Unless "DATA VISUALIZATION")
Data: 

IMDb movie ratings by scrapping the website using BeautifulSoup and requests. https://www.imdb.com/ 



Goal: 

We have decided to delve into the world of Hollywood for our project and see what makes the movies industry tick with some Hypotheses.

A new movie company has approached us and they are interested in getting their first movie on the IMDB top 50 page for highest gross revenue in 2020

As Data Scientists we have some hypotheses about this new project and we would like to have some assumptions that are statistically significant and hope to guide the new movie production company in the right direction to make their first movie


 

Hypotheses:

1.Movies of Action genre generate more gross box office than Romance movies

2.Movies with higher budget make more revenue in box office

3.High grossing movies have a higher IMDB rating

4.Movies from 2010-2018 make a higher gross revenue than movies between 2000-2010
